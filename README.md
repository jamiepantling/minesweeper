# Sproutsweeper!

## Introduction

*Sproutsweeper!* is a version of the classic computer game "minesweeper". 

It's a game of logic (and a little luck), where you determine the location of Brussels sprouts dotted randomly on a grid.

Minesweeper's roots may go back as far as the 60s or 70s, but has been around in its familiar style since the 80s. When Microsoft released its version in 1990, it became a go-to time-killer for bored executives.

Styled with 90s colours in honour of minesweeper's heyday, *Sproutsweeper*! centres around saving your dinner from Brussels sprouts - every 90s British kid's least favourite vegetable.

## Gameplay

After your first click on the board (if you haven't clicked on a sprout!) you can deduce the location of sprouts through the numbers, which show how many sprouts are adjacent to that square.

You can flag the locations of sprouts with a right click (right-click again to unflag). The number of mines left to flag is shown at the top right of the grid.

If you manage to flag all the mines (with no wrongly flagged squares), you win! The emoji will turn to a "yummy" face. There's a timer at the top right so you can remember your time and try and beat it!

But if you accidentally click on a sprout - you lose.
